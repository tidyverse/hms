## Overview

The hms package provides a simple class for storing durations or time-of-day values and displaying them in the hh:mm:ss format.  This class is intended to simplify data exchange with databases, spreadsheets, and other data sources:

- Stores values as a numeric vector that contains the number of seconds
since midnight
- Supports construction from explicit hour, minute, or second values
- Supports coercion to and from various data types, including `POSIXt`
- Can be used as column in a data frame
- Based on the `difftime` class
- Values can exceed the 24-hour boundary or be negative
- By default, fractional seconds up to a microsecond are displayed, regardless of the value of the `"digits.secs"` option

## Installation

```r
# The easiest way to get hms is to install the whole tidyverse:
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Alternatively, install just hms:
install.packages("hms")

# Or the the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/hms")
```

## Usage

The following example showcases ways of using the `hms` class standalone or as a data frame column.

```{r}
library(hms)

hms(56, 34, 12)
as_hms(1)
as_hms("12:34:56")
as_hms(Sys.time())
as.POSIXct(hms(1))

data.frame(hours = 1:3, hms = hms(hours = 1:3))
```
